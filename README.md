> Jest Test Explorer is in a preview state and may not yet support all environments. Please file any issues you encounter on our GitHub repo.

## Getting Started
* Install the extension and restart VS Code
* Open a project with Jest tests
  * Currently limited to Jest being available from the `./node_modules/.bin/jest` path from the VS Code workspace directory. We are working to make this more flexible.
* Open the Test view
* Run / Debug your tests in the Test Explorer
